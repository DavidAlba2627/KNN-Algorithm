# K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier Repository

Welcome to the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm repository, an integral part of my exploration into machine learning algorithms, as documented on my blog [Data Science For Lifelong Learning](https://datasciencelifelonglearn.blogspot.com). This space is meticulously curated to offer both novices and experts a deep understanding of the KNN algorithm, its applications, and its significance in the realm of supervised learning.

## Overview

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a type of instance-based learning that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates on a simple principle: a data point is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the data point being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors. This repository not only provides a hands-on Python implementation of the KNN algorithm but also delves into its underlying mechanics, strengths, and potential areas of improvement. Through a combination of theoretical exposition and practical demonstration, the content here aims to offer a holistic understanding of KNN.

## Repository Structure

- **[Implementation](./Implementation/Readme.md)**: A detailed exposition of the KNN algorithm, discussing its methodology, applications, and nuances.

- **[Code](./Implementation/Code/)**: Python scripts that implement the KNN algorithm. For a detailed breakdown of the codebase, refer to the [Code Readme](./Implementation/Code/Readme.md).
  
- **[Images](./Images/)**: Contains visual assets and graphical results pertinent to the KNN algorithm.

## Python Implementation

The codebase is meticulously structured to ensure clarity, modularity, and ease of adaptation.

- **Data Creation**: [create_dataset.py](./Implementation/Code/create_dataset.py)
- **KNN Logic**: [knn_function.py](./Implementation/Code/knn_function.py)
- **Visualization**: [visualize_results.py](./Implementation/Code/visualize_results.py)
- **Demonstration**: [knn_demo.py](./Implementation/Code/knn_demo.py)

## Getting Started

To run the KNN demonstration:
