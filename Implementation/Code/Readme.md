# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm: Codebase Overview

Welcome to the technical segment of the KNN Algorithm repository. This directory encapsulates the Python implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm, a fundamental paradigm in supervised machine learning. The scripts contained here are crafted with precision, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. They serve as a comprehensive demonstration of the algorithm's capabilities and offer a modular foundation for further exploration or adaptation in diverse applications.

## File Structure

1. **create_dataset.py**: 
   - This script is responsible for generating a synthetic dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, and standardizing it. 
   - The `generate_dataset` function allows customization of the dataset’s size, noise level, and the proportion allocated to the test set.

2. **knn_function.py**: 
   - Houses the core implementation of the KNN algorithm. 
   - Includes functions to find the labels of the k-nearest neighbors of a given data point and predict the labels of a test dataset based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.

3. **visualize_results.py**: 
   - Contains functions to visualize the original dataset, the predictions made by the KNN algorithm, and the confusion matrix. 
   - Employs various plotting techniques to offer a clear and intuitive representation of the classification results.

4. **knn_demo.py**: 
   - This script integrates all the components, demonstrating the entire process from dataset creation and standardization to KNN classification and result visualization. 
   - Provides a hands-on example of applying the KNN algorithm and visualizing its outcomes.

## Usage

Each script is well-commented, offering insights into the specific roles and operations of different code segments. To execute the KNN demonstration:

- Run the `knn_demo.py` script.

This will generate and standardize a synthetic dataset, apply the KNN algorithm for classification, and visualize the results, including the original dataset, predictions, and the confusion matrix. The accuracy of the classification is also computed and displayed.

## Visualization Functions

- `plot_predictions`: 
   - Visualizes the predictions made by the KNN algorithm on the test dataset, with points colored according to their predicted labels.

- `compare_with_correct`: 
   - Compares the KNN predictions with the correct labels, highlighting misclassified points in red to offer a clear contrast between accurate and inaccurate classifications.

- `visualize_confusion_matrix`: 
   - Deploys a heatmap to represent the confusion matrix, offering a visual interpretation of the algorithm’s performance in classifying each class.

## Customization

The codebase is designed for adaptability. You can easily modify parameters such as the number of neighbors, dataset size, noise level, and test set proportion to explore the KNN algorithm’s behavior under different conditions and configurations. Each script and function is modular, facilitating easy integration into broader projects or more complex workflows.
